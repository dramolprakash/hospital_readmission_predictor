READMISSION MODEL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
=============================================

FILES INCLUDED:
- readmission_model_*.joblib: Trained model
- label_encoders.joblib: Feature encoders (if applicable)
- feature_scaler.joblib: Feature scaler (if applicable)
- feature_names.txt: List of required features
- model_metadata.txt: Model information and performance
- predict_readmission.py: Prediction script

DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- joblib

USAGE:
1. Load model: model = joblib.load('readmission_model_*.joblib')
2. Prepare patient data with required features
3. Make prediction: probability = model.predict_proba(data)[:, 1]
4. Apply business rules for intervention

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION:
- Probability >= 0.5: High risk, consider intervention
- Probability 0.3-0.5: Moderate risk, monitor closely
- Probability < 0.3: Low risk, standard care

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
- Precision: 19.4%
- Recall: 46.4%
- Expected ROI: 46%
